Prisoner's dilemma
Relevant sections in text: 1.3, 2.2.1

This assignment presents a simple game-playing program, in which
strategies are represented as higher-order procedures.  The Game of Twenty-One assignment takes a similar
approach.  The prisoner's dilemma game also uses some simple
list-manipulation commands.  There is an opportunity here to run
prisoner's dilemma tournament for the class.

We are grateful to Franklyn Turbak, Mike Eisenberg, and Mitch Resnick
for developing this assignment.
