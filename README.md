# Study SICP
This repository contains the infomation I used for learning the
[SICP][1] Course.

## Goals:
The Goals is inherited from [MIT 6.001 Courses][8]
Design, implement and test recursive programs in Scheme that demonstrate the following concepts:
- Building Abstractions:
  - Computational Processes
  - Higher-order Procedures
  - Compound Data
  - Data Abstractions

- Controlling Interactions:
  - Generic Operations
  - Self-describing Data
  - Message Passing
  - Streams and Infinite Data Structures
  - Object-oriented Programming
  
- Meta-linguistic Abstraction:
  - Interpretation of Programming Languages
  - Embedded Languages

## Schedule:
The study schedule follows the [schedule of 6.001][3].

## Resources:
### Reading Materials
- [SICP-PDF][9] is PDF version of SICP optimized for bitmap images
- SICP Lecture Videos
- [Notes][5] in [MIT 6.001 Open Course][4]

### Practice Materials
- SICP PDF Exercises
- [MIT SICP Programming Assignments][2] is used in MIT's introductory computer science subject. 
- [Quizs][6] and [Projects][7] in [MIT 6.001 Open Course][4] is also included.
