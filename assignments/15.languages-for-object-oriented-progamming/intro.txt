Languages for object-oriented programming 
Relevant sections in text: 4.1

In this assignment, students assume the role of language designer, and
consider issues in the design of languages for object-oriented
programming by working with a version of the metacircular evaluator
that has been extended to include classes, methods, and inheritance.
The programming language used here is modelled on the Dylan language,
and the extensions to the evaluator follow the approach described in
The Art of the Metaobject Protocol, by Gregor Kiczales, Jim
des Rivieres, and Dan Bobrow (MIT Press, 1991).

This is a different object-oriented programming system than the one
used in the object-oriented adventure
game assignment.

Note: The construction of this assignment predates our final revison
of the text for this second edition, so there are several minor
differences between the code here and the metacircular evaluator as
given in section 4.1.  You may wish to update the code (notably some
of the syntax procedures and data structures) before assigning this.
