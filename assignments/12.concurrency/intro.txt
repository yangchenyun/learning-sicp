Concurrency
Relevant sections in text: 3.4

This assignment explores issues of synchronization and concurrency in
the context of simulating a currency-exchange market.

 The code for this assignment relies on the
parallel-execute facility (see the text, section 3.4).  If
you are not running MIT Scheme, this may be difficult to arrange.
The file parallel.scm below gives an implementation of
parallel-execute in terms of primitives included in MIT
Scheme, but which are not part of the Scheme standard.
