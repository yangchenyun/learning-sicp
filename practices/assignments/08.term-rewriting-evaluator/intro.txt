Term-rewriting evaluator
Relevant sections in text: 1.1, 2.3

This is an extensive assignment, which develops an alternative view of
evaluation to the one presented in chapters 3 and 4 of the text.  This
view extends the informal substitution model of section 1.1 to a full
term-rewriting model for evaluating Scheme expressions.  Working
through this assignment provides experience with the
formal view of language syntax and semantics, as well as considerable
exercise with symbolic manipulation.

In order to do the assignment, students will need to read the
supplementary handout (provided below), which describes term rewriting
and the evaluation model.

We are grateful to Prof. Albert Meyer of MIT for developing this
assignment and the underlying model.
