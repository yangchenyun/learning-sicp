Picture language
Relevant section in text: 2.2.4

This is the original material on the square-limit language, which was revised
to form section 2.2.4 of the book.  For explanations of how the
language works, you should use the book rather than the assignment
text given here.  We have not included a postscript file here, because
the explanation (and the figures) in the book are better.

The code below includes an implementation of primitive painters for
line-drawings and two-dimensional images.  This code is specific to
MIT Scheme.  It includes a constructor that creates primitive painters
from pgm files.
