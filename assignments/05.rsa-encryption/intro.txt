RSA encryption
Relevant sections in text: 1.2.6, 2.2.1

The assignment begins with the fast exponentiation and primality
testing in section 1.2 and expands it to produce an implementation of
the RSA system for public-key encryption.  Students will also need to
use lists to represent sequences and write simple car-cdr
manipulations.

Before assigning this, you should consider updating "the story"  to
something more contemporary and less MIT-specific.

 Disclaimer for all the cryptographers who are waiting to pounce on
us: The system described here is a "pure RSA" system, which is not
secure in practice.
